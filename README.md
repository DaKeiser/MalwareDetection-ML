 - The report for the assignment is saved as 'Malware_Detection_Report.pdf'
 - All the hyperparameters that we had for various models are saved in 'HyperParameters.pdf'
 - We have submitted 2 best models. You can find them in 'Models' folder
 
 - The top submission of ours which got a score of 0.71103 on Private LB is in '#1-Voting folder'
 - For Voting we had used multiple models to get a consolidated score.
 - To reproduce those CSVs please look at 'reproduce' folder
 - The structure of all the notebooks in 'reproduce' is the same. Only the model has been changed in all
 - Demo Notebook has been saved as 'demo.ipynb' on whose basis we made the rest of notebooks in the folder
 - Explanation for 'demo.ipynb' is in 'demo.py
 -  Incase you want to skip the part where you run all the notebooks to get the CSVs, we have CSVs stored in drive
 [Link to Drive](https://iiitborg-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/sai_rithwik_iiitb_org/EsZcTCoI21xErUvGW-Kfh2EBNap9jZWGCcHuIEhE1j3kMw?e=sQejYr)

 Please head over to 'Models/#1-Voting/reproduce/CSV' folder to find all relevant CSVs

 - The second best submission is for XGBoost.
 - Notebook is saved as 'xgboost-submission.ipynb
 - It's relevant script is saved as 'xgboost-submission.py'

 BONUS
 - We had also implemented a stacking based model. Incase you want to view it it is present on the drive

 Please head over to 'Models/#3-Stacking/ to find all relevant models.
